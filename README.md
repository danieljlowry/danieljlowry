## Hey, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

Currently a Senior student studying at Florida Gulf Coast University, majoring in Software Engineering.

Foundational background in backend development using C/C++, Java, and Python. Additionally, I've worked with the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller using C++ and Assembly.

Continuing to improve back-end skills as well as breaking into front-end development, with the eventual goal to be full stack developer. 

Thanks for stopping by! And please feel free to message me, I'd love to chat!
